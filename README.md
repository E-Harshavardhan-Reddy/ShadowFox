SHADOWFOX-TASKS - Beginner-Friendly Visualization Documentation
🌟 Python Visualization Guide for Beginners
📘 A clean and beginner-friendly documentation guide for two of the most powerful Python visualization libraries — Matplotlib and Seaborn — created as part of the Shadow Fox Data Science Internship.

📂 Project Structure
File	Description
Library_Overview.md	📖 Introduction to Matplotlib and Seaborn with practical use cases
Graph_Types_with_Code.md	🧪 Side-by-side examples: line plots, bar charts, histograms, scatter plots, etc.
Comparison.md	⚖️ Comparison of both libraries based on usability, aesthetics, flexibility
Resources.md	🔗 Links to official documentation for deeper learning

🎯 Project Objective
This documentation is designed to help beginners get started with Python visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn. It focuses on:

👶 Easy-to-understand explanations

✅ Ready-to-run code snippets

🧠 Real-world visualization use cases

🛠️ Clear comparison to guide library selection

🧰 Technologies Used
Python

Matplotlib – foundational plotting library

Seaborn – advanced statistical visualization

Pandas – tabular data handling

NumPy – efficient numerical operations

🖼️ Sample Plots
📁 A plots/ folder with sample images of output graphs will be added soon for visual reference.

📘 Getting Started
To try out the code examples, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy

## 🎨 Matplotlib – Overview

**Matplotlib** is a powerful and flexible 2D plotting library in Python. It helps in creating static, animated, and even interactive visualizations. Using Matplotlib, you can create:

- 📈 Line charts  
- 📊 Bar graphs  
- 📉 Scatter plots  
- 📦 Histograms  
- 🥧 Pie charts — and more.

Matplotlib gives full control over plot elements — like titles, axes, colors, gridlines, legends, and figure sizes — making it ideal for **customized and publication-ready plots**.

### ✅ Key Features
- Supports many plot types
- Full customization of visuals
- Works with NumPy arrays and lists
- Great for scientific and academic plots

### 💡 Use Cases
- Creating visuals from scratch
- Customizing charts for presentations/reports
- Plotting research data

## 🌈 Seaborn – Overview

**Seaborn** is a high-level library built on top of Matplotlib. It’s designed to make **statistical visualizations easier and more attractive**, especially when working with pandas DataFrames.

It provides beautiful default styles, color palettes, and plot types like:

- 🧪 Box plots  
- 🧬 Violin plots  
- 🔥 Heatmaps  
- 📊 Categorical bar plots  
- 🤝 Pair plots

Seaborn handles many of the details for you, so your code stays clean and simple — great for beginners!

### ✅ Key Features
- Simplified statistical plotting
- Directly supports pandas DataFrames
- Comes with themes and palettes
- Clean and concise code

### 💡 Use Cases
- Quick data exploration
- Building statistical charts with less effort
- Creating visually appealing plots for reports

| **Interactivity**    | Basic (via Matplotlib widgets)                  | Limited (uses Matplotlib backend)                    |
| **Data Handling**    | Works with lists, arrays, Series                | Works best with pandas DataFrames                   |
| **Visual Aesthetics**| Manual styling                                 | Beautiful default themes and palettes               |
| **Performance**      | Fast, even for large datasets                   | Fast, but slightly slower for very large data        |
| **Plot Variety**     | All types including 3D & pie charts             | Best for statistical and structured plots            |
| **Learning Curve**   | Steeper for beginners                           | Easier for beginners with clean output               |
| **Use Case**         | Custom & detailed plots                         | Quick EDA and statistical visualizations             |
